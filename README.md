# ‚ú® About this Project
Renters Speak gives users a peek behind the curtain of the New York City rental market. Designed for renters looking for more information about their current or prospective landlords, this app provides a platform for users to write and share reviews of landlords and also presents data related to building ownership and building maintenance violations from NYC housing datasets. Users can search for information by address and Renters Speak provides reviews and housing data in an easy to understand, visually appealing format.

## Features

### Create New User Account and Existing User Login
Users can register for a new account on the "Create New Account" page and existing users can login on the "Login" page. Bootstrap modal boxes implemented with Javascript interactive elements notify users of a successful or unsuccessful login request.

### Logged In Users Can Write a Review
Users that are logged in can write and submit a review on the "Write a Review" page. The review is then saved to the database and available for other viewers on the detail page for that address.

### Search an Address
Using the NYC Geosearch API and an AJAX request utilizing the JQuery UI Autocomplete widget, user input is sanitized and normalized and a list of matching NYC addresses is presented to the user to choose from.

### Address Details - Reviews
When a searched address is submitted, the database is queried to present detailed information for the matching address. The Google Maps API is implemented to display a styled map of the searched address. Below the map, the Bootstrap CSS framework is used to organize and display information by tabs including a tab for renter reviews that match the specific address.

### Address Details - Landlord Information
Another tab displays ownership and landlord information for the address and includes interactive Javascript dropdowns with more detailed information.

### Address Details - Violation Information: Charts
The violations tab displays information about NYC housing violations related to the address. The first section contains interactive dropdowns that expand to display charts created with the Chart.js library to visually represent housing violation information by class and over time.

### Address Details - Violations List
The violations tab also contains a list of all violations for the searched address which includes information about the date, class and description of each violation. Interactive Javascript buttons and alerts allow the user to diplay fewer, more, or all violations for a particular address.

## Instructions to Run Renters Speak Web App:

### Setup:
Use `git clone` or other method to copy entire contents of this repository to your local machine.

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, `python3 -m pip install` or other).

Run `source secrets.sh` in terminal to execute contents of `secrets.sh`.

### Seed the Database:

Clone the <a href="https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb" target="_blank">NYCDB tool</a> to your local development environment.

Use the postgres command `createdb <name of database>` to create the database.

#### Load datasets from NYCDB into your database:
Run `nycdb -U <postgres username> -P <postgres password> -D <name of database> --load hpd_registrations` to load the hpd_registrations and hpd_contacts tables. <br><br>
Run `nycdb -U <postgres username> -P <postgres password> -D <name of database> --load hpd_violations` to load the hpd_violations table.<br>

Run run model.py interactively `python3 -i model.py` and then run `db.create_all()` to create all the other tables in the database.

<!-- in shell: -->
<!-- `dropdb testdb` -->
<!-- `createdb testdb` -->
<!-- `nycdb -U <postgres username> -P <postgres password> -D testdb --load hpd_registrations` loads hpd_registrations and hpd_contacts tables, takes about 2 mins -->
<!-- if you run and 'nycdb' command and get bash error: command not found,
    try running `pip3 install  nycdb` -->
<!-- if you run 'nycdb' command and get bash error: nycdb command not found,
    try running `pip3 install -e <add path to folder in nycdb containing setup.py> 
    i.e, <../nycdb/src>` -->
<!-- `nycdb -U <postgres username> -P <postgres password> -D testdb --load hpd_violations` -->
<!-- creates SQL table in testdb
    hpd_violations rows should load, will take about 20-50 mins -->
<!-- run model.py interactively: `python3 -i model.py` -->
<!-- `db.create_all()`  creates all other tables in testdb -->
<!-- in shell: -->
<!--`python3 seed_db.py`  Commented out lines to dropdb, createdb and db.create_all() -->

<!-- Enter `python3 seed_db.py`in terminal to seed database `testdb` with test data. <br> -->

#### Query the Database
To view and query test database using SQL queries, enter `psql testdb` from terminal and enter (`\q` to exit).<br>

To query `testdb`using SQLAlchemy queries,  run `model.py` in interactive mode and use `quit()` to exit.

### To Run the Server:
Create a virtual environment in your local directory using `virtualenv env` or another virtual environment library.<br>

Activate virtual environment by entering `source env/bin/activate` in terminal<br>
    Your command prompt should then show `(env)` at the beginning of the line<br>

In terminal, enter `python3 server.py`<br>
You should then see:<br>
    "Connected to the db!<br>
    * Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)"<br>

Next, in a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`<br>
You should then see the Renters Speak homepage!

To exit and stop running server, enter `CTRL + c` or `CMD + c`


### To Run Tests:
In terminal, enter `python3 tests.py`<br>
The output will tell you how many tests ran and how many failed of the tests that ran.
